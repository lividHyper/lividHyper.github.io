On the one hand, I hope to share some of my thoughts on work and life with everyone, and on the other hand, I also want to exercise my writing ability.\nWork well with tools As a tool enthusiast, I always have difficulty choosing tools. Considering that the main purpose of a blog is to write something down, I still use the simplest Github Pages + Hugo to build it. The PaperMod theme recommended by my friend is also very much in line with my aesthetics. Here, I will make a brief review of the construction of the entire blog.\nOverall structure Hugo configuration Hugo itself is implemented using the Go language, and its configuration has a certain learning curve.

The secrets and configurations of Github Action are not mentioned too much here. Here is an example of my .github/workflows/deploy.yml:\nname: deploy on: push: workflow_dispatch: jobs: build: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - name: Checkout uses: actions/checkout@v2 with: submodules: true fetch-depth: 0 - name: Setup Hugo uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2 with: hugo-version: \u0026#34;latest\u0026#34; - name: Build Web run: hugo - name: Deploy Web uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3 with: PERSONAL_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PERSONAL_TOKEN }} EXTERNAL_REPOSITORY: lividHyper/lividHyper.github.io PUBLISH_BRANCH: main PUBLISH_DIR: ./public commit_message: ${{ github.event.head_commit.message }} Image Hosting Configuration Since I use Github to host my blog, I will skip the configuration of an image hosting service and simply embed the images directly into my blog as static resources.\nComments Since my blog is not yet heavily trafficked, I will hold off on introducing a commenting system for now. I will consider implementing a more mature solution in the future.\n","permalink":"https://lividhyper.github.io/en/some-tips-when-build-blog-with-hugo/","summary":"Translate By ChatGPT.
